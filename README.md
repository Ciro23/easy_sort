## easysort
define an unordered list and wait for it to be sorted and see how much time it took!

### just... why?
just a simple concept to over-engineering for the sake of doing. also it's really interesting to study about sorting
algorithms.

### usage
there are two ways to specify which list to sort:
1. command line, execute the program without specifying any parameter, you'll get asked about everything needed
2. text file, write each of the elements of the list in a line of the file and execute the program with the name of the
algorithm as the first parameter and the file to read path as the second one.

list elements are read as double, any inconvertible data is not added to the final list.

the goal would be allowing users to specify themselves which data type to use.
